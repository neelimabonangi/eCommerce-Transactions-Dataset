Project Overview:
In the dynamic world of eCommerce, understanding customer behavior is essential.This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of transactional data to extract actionable business insights.Our approach includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Delving deep into the data to uncover hidden patterns and trends.
Lookalike Modeling: Crafting models to identify potential customers mirroring the traits of our most valuable clientele.
Customer Segmentation: Employing clustering techniques to categorize customers, enabling tailored marketing strategies.

Objectives:
Uncover Insights: Through EDA, gain a profound understanding of sales dynamics and customer preferences.
Identify Potential Customers: Leverage lookalike models to pinpoint prospects resembling our top-tier customers.
Segment the Customer Base: Utilize clustering to define distinct customer groups, facilitating personalized engagement.

Dataset:
Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that includes:

Transactions: Detailed records of each purchase, capturing specifics like invoice numbers, product codes, descriptions, quantities, dates, prices, customer IDs, and countries. 
Customers: Profiles providing insights into demographics and behaviors, such as customer IDs and associated purchase histories.
Products: Extensive information on items in our catalog, including product identifiers, names, descriptions, pricing, availability, and categories.
This rich dataset enables a thorough analysis of sales patterns, customer behaviors, and market trends within the e-commerce industry.
